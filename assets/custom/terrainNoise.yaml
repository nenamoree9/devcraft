# NOTE: If you don't want to use a particular value, like if you want fractal to be None
# Just don't include that section

# Noise types available are: 
# [ OpenSimplex2, OpenSimplex2s Cellular, Perlin, ValueCubic, Value ]

# Fractal types available are:
# [ None, FBM, Ridged, PingPong ]
# NOTE: FBM is Fractal Brownian Motion

# NOTE: The weight is how much of an effect the particular generator has in the combined noise
