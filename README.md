How to mod/reskin Devcraft:

Reminder: All re-skins or mods you make have to be OPEN SOURCE. Do not make your re-skins/mods closed source.

----Minecraft Week (0.1)----

First, do the same process you will do when you download a Devcraft version.
Next, open the Res folder.
There are 3 folders;
- Blocks
- Fonts
- Textures

The "Blocks" folder is where block metadata is stored in. The blocks' metadata file is a ".block" file.
The "Fonts" folder is where all the fonts are stored in. Usually, the fonts are .ttf files. (Note: When editing or replacing fonts, they SHOULD always have the name "rs.ttf".
The "Textures" folder is where all the game's textures are stored in.
